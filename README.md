# pulsev2
Pulse ‚Äî Product & Engineering Specification (v1.0)

Last updated: 12 Aug 2025

1) One‚Äëline concept

A discreet, consent‚Äëfirst app for couples to signal desire (‚Äúpulses‚Äù), coordinate the best moments, and keep intimacy fun with lightweight planning, insights, and optional surprises.

Platforms: iOS & Android (Expo/React Native).Stack: Expo Router (SDK 52), TypeScript, Supabase (Auth, Postgres, Storage, Edge Functions), Expo Push, RevenueCat (or native StoreKit/Billing) for IAP, PostHog for analytics (self‚Äëhostable).No LDR mode (out of scope per positioning).

2) Users & Roles

User: individual account.

Partnered Pair: 1:1 link between two users. (Free: 1 pairing max.)

Admin: for abuse reports/help (minimal tooling).

Consent & safety are core: every signal is opt‚Äëin, discreet UI, and configurable privacy.

3) Core Value & Epics

E1 ‚Äî Pairing & Onboarding

Goal: Seamless account creation and a stress‚Äëfree way to connect with your partner.

Email/Apple/Google sign‚Äëin (Supabase Auth + OAuth).

Create or accept a Pairing Invite (6‚Äëdigit code or QR).

Quick preferences: preferred Pulse icons set, quiet hours, boundaries (green/yellow/red), notification style (ultra‚Äëdiscreet).

Optional calendar connect (read‚Äëonly; Apple, Google, Outlook) to suggest time windows.
Done when: A new user can pair in <60s and land on Home with partner avatar showing.

E2 ‚Äî Send & Respond to Pulses

Goal: One‚Äëtap, private signaling that respects context and boundaries.

Compose: choose icon (e.g., flame, wink, cuddle), intensity (1‚Äì3), time window proposal (e.g., ‚Äútonight 20:00‚Äì22:00‚Äù), optional note, location hint (coarse, not GPS precise), expiry (e.g., 24h).

Delivery: push notification with obfuscated text (e.g., ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got a Pulse üîí‚Äù).

Responses: Accept, Nudge (propose new time), Not now (with auto‚Äësoft reply like ‚Äúrain check?‚Äù), Snooze (1‚Äì24h).

Read receipts (on/off).

Boundaries engine: blocks pulses beyond red boundaries; yellow prompts extra confirmation.Done when: Both partners can exchange pulses end‚Äëto‚Äëend with confirmations and see final status.

E3 ‚Äî Calendar‚ÄëAware Planning

Goal: Suggest ‚Äúbest moments‚Äù without heavy scheduling.

Import calendars read‚Äëonly; maintain local free/busy map.

Smart suggestions: ranked slots (e.g., energy patterns + free time + commute).

Create a Moment event: optional calendar write‚Äëback (user‚Äëopt‚Äëin).

Snooze Toggle on dashboard: pause suggestions for a duration.
Done when: User sees 3‚Äì5 suggested windows daily and can one‚Äëtap schedule.

E4 ‚Äî Surprise Mode (Micro‚Äëtransactions supported)

Goal: Keep things playful with minimal effort.

‚ÄúRoll the dice‚Äù generates a contextual mini‚Äëplan (home/outside, budget, duration).

Private checklist UI (no explicit wording in notifications).
Done when: User can buy a pack and trigger a surprise plan that fits constraints.

E5 ‚Äî Insights (Premium)

Goal: Lightweight, private analytics to understand patterns.

Heatmap by day/time of accepted pulses.

Streaks, average response times, preferred windows.

Privacy: all metrics are couple‚Äëlocal; no social comparison.Done when: Insights page renders with last 30/90‚Äëday metrics and export toggle.

E6 ‚Äî Parent Mode (Discreet Mode)

Goal: Protect privacy in public/family contexts.

Biometric/Passcode gate to open app.

Replace explicit terms with euphemisms; neutral icons.

Hide previews and obfuscate notifications.
Done when: Enabling Parent Mode fully obfuscates app UI until unlocked.

E7 ‚Äî Theming & Stickers (IAP)

Goal: Personalization and fun.

Theme picker (color sets) + icon packs.

Store screen to browse/buy/apply.
Done when: Purchases sync across devices and apply instantly.
